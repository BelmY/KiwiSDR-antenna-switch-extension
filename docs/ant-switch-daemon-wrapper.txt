ant-switch-daemon-wrapper is script that allows controlling antenna switch from telnet.

== Install instructions ==

Take ssh connection to your KiwiSDR as root and then

sudo apt-get install xinetd
mkdir -p /root/extensions/ant_switch/daemon/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OH1KK/KiwiSDR-antenna-switch-extension/ant-switch-daemon/daemon/ant-switch-daemon > /etc/xinetd.d/ant-switch-daemon
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OH1KK/KiwiSDR-antenna-switch-extension/ant-switch-daemon/daemon/ant-switch-daemon-wrapper > /root/extensions/ant_switch/daemon/ant-switch-daemon-wrapper
chmod a+rx /root/extensions/ant_switch/daemon/ant-switch-daemon-wrapper
/etc/init.d/xinetd restart

== Usage ==

Daemon takes (almost) same commands as ant-switch-frontend

You can command from linux console using netcat

    echo "s" | nc kiwisdr.example.org 65000

Or just telnet to your kiwisdr
 
    telnet kiwisdr.example.org 65000

and give a command, for example h for help

Note. Some antenna switch commands are restricted in ant-switch-daemon-wrapper, look at source code and modify if needed.

== Security ==

If you do not want open your antenna switch to public, restrict it only to your private network

Modify /etc/xinetd.d/ant-switch-daemon and add restictive lines

    only_from	    = 127.0.0.1 192.168.0.0/16 2001:DB8::/32

== Bugs etc ==

If something goes wrong, look first syslog, cat /var/log/syslog
